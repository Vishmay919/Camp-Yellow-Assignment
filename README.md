To improve the UX of this Webpage, I have implemented the following:-

1. Removed the video component from the page and provided a link to it. This was done to reduce clutter on the page and make it more visually appealing. Additionally, users are more likely to engage with the website if they are not overwhelmed by information.

2. Added a hero section with a heading and subheading that clearly defines the website's purpose. The aim was to communicate the website's value proposition in a concise and compelling way, which would help users understand the benefits of using the website.

3. Created a multistep form to improve the user flow and minimize the cognitive load. By dividing the form into smaller, manageable steps, users can focus on one task at a time, which makes the overall experience less daunting. Feedback is provided on top to help users understand their progress and navigate through the form efficiently.

4. Added a loading progress bar to provide users with a sense of control and transparency. This helps users understand how long the process will take and what to expect. The loading bar also reduces anxiety and increases engagement, as users are less likely to abandon the website if they can see that progress is being made.

these design decisions were made with the goal of improving the website's usability, clarity, and engagement, and providing a seamless user experience.
